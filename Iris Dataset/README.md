# The Iris Dataset

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. The iris dataset is a built-in dataset in R that contains measurements on 4 different attributes (in centimeters) for 50 flowers from 3 different species.

# Details

The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
