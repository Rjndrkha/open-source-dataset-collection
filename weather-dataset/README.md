# Description

To predict the weather, we need to measure the weather. If you want to know the weather is like tomorrow, it's pretty important to know what the weather was like today and yesterday. Knowing the average weather on a particular day of the year is also useful. Collecting data every day can show you patterns and trends, and help you figure out how our atmosphere works.
